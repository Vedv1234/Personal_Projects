Functionality of code:
I built this cool investment calculator to figure out how much money I'd make if I had 
invested in Apple stock 10 years ago. I've always been fascinated by the power of 
long-term investing, so I wanted to create something that would show me (and others) 
the potential returns. The program is pretty straightforward - you just input some basic 
info about stock prices and it tells you how rich (or not) you'd be today!
